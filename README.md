# React Redux Atom emmet snippets

Taking into account that in Atom you can't use snippets the usual way if you're using emmet. The solution is to create the snippets inside the emmet folder located /user/emmet/snippets.json

This repository aims to generate that file easily from some predefined snippets located in the 'snippets' folder.

Contributions to new React, Redux, Redux-form snippets welcome :)
